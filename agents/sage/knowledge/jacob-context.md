# Jacob Context - For Sage (Business Coach)

## Stated Telos (Mission Statement)

**Short form:**
"To order my life toward heaven while faithfully stewarding life on earth, growing in holiness and participating in God's work in others."

**Long form:**
"To aim continually at heaven while I work diligently on earth to ensure the small step towards holiness I take for myself and those around me today is only to be exceeded by the step I take tomorrow."

**Key elements:**
- Heaven-centric focus — Value comes from God alone
- Practicality — Not abstract spirituality
- Constant progress — Each day exceeding the last
- Starts with God who uses me to impact others

### Supporting Scripture
- Colossians 3:17 — Everything done in the name of the Lord
- Romans 12:1 — Bodies as living sacrifice
- Ephesians 2:10 — God's workmanship, created for good works
- Galatians 2:20 — Crucified with Christ, Christ lives through me

## Operating Principles

### 1. Rooted in God, Unmoved by the World
Identity, confidence, and courage anchored in God — not outcomes, approval, status, or comparison. Because secure in Him, can act boldly, listen openly, change without fear.
- Depends fully on God, takes responsibility seriously
- Resists external pressure and internal pride
- Confidence never excuses unteachability

**Check:** "Am I grounded in trust right now — or just attached to being right?"

### 2. Move Fast, Remain Unhurried
Bias toward action, momentum, progress while guarding inner calm and relational steadiness. Move quickly without anxiety or rushing judgment.
- Speed over perfection; progress through iteration
- Urgency in execution, patience with people
- Calm is not slowness — it is control

**Check:** "Does my pace create clarity and safety — or just motion?"

### 3. Systems Beat Willpower
Design life so right actions are default and energy is spent where it matters most. Discipline through design beats heroics through effort.
- Eliminate waste, friction, repetition
- Build systems that serve people, not replace them
- Use structure to protect judgment, creativity, presence

**Check:** "Is the system serving the people involved — or hiding from necessary human friction?"

### 4. Leave Things Better
Every interaction, responsibility, and system improved by involvement — without creating dependence. Love expressed through stewardship, not control.
- People matter as much as outcomes
- Clarity, care, ownership compound over time
- "Better" means stronger, clearer, more capable — not just more comfortable

**Check:** "Am I actually helping — or just taking ownership that isn't mine?"

**Governance:**
- Day-to-day autonomy within respective areas
- Mutual agreement required for: sale, debt, distributions, compensation changes, major capex, new business lines
- Advisory board to be established for deadlock resolution

**Long-term:**
- 2037: Control shifts to Jacob 51% / Monica 49% (economic arrangement unchanged)

## Areas to Challenge

Based on the Coach Constitution and Jacob's patterns, regularly probe:

1. **Overwork as stewardship** — Is the work pace justified or avoidance?
2. **Cash/security hoarding** — Is financial caution actually fear?
3. **Systems avoiding human friction** — Are processes replacing necessary conversations?
4. **Growth outpacing formation** — Is business scaling faster than character?
5. **Precision displacing love** — Are systems serving people or the other way around?
6. **Partnership dynamics** — Is the Monica relationship being stewarded well?
7. **Family prioritization** — Are wife and kids getting real presence, not just time?
