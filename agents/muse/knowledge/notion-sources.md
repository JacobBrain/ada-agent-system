# Notion Sources

## Social Content Database
- **Database ID**: `f4b5f998-58ed-45e9-9a13-acbb0322a217`
- **Use for**: LinkedIn posts, Substack content, general social media ideas
- **Title field**: `Content`
- **Status field**: `Tags`
  - `Idea` — unpublished ideas
  - `Draft` — work in progress
  - `Published` — already posted

## Querying Ideas
Filter by `Tags` status equals `Idea` to get unpublished content ideas.

## Adding New Ideas
When adding a new idea to the database:
1. Set the `Content` field with a clear, concise title
2. **Always include a description** in the page body explaining:
   - The core insight or angle discussed
   - Key points or examples to include
   - Any specific framing Jacob mentioned
3. Set `Tags` to `Idea`

This ensures ideas have enough context to be useful later, not just a title.

## Preferences
- When Jacob asks for content ideas, present **3-5 of the strongest options** rather than just 1-2
- Prioritize ideas that are timely, have a clear angle, or connect to recent conversations
