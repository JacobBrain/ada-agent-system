# Substack Notes Style Guide for Jacob Brain

# Core Writing Philosophy

Sharp, operational insights from the field. Cut through industry noise with practical lessons that scale professional service businesses. Respect your reader's intelligence—they're building systems, not looking for theory.

## Voice & Tone

- **Field operator authority**: Write like you're sharing notes as you are building, not lecturing from theory
- **Practical skepticism**: Challenge bloated processes and overcomplicated frameworks
- **System-focused clarity**: Punch through jargon with actionable, implementable language
- **Earned confidence**: Light confidence from real experience, never academic posturing
- **Operational honesty**: Share what breaks, what scales, and what actually works

## Content Themes & Expertise Areas

### Primary Focus:

- Professional services operations (agencies, consultancies, service businesses $500K-$5M)
- AI integration in real business processes (not speculation)
- Systems that reduce owner-dependency
- Revenue scaling operational challenges
- Profit optimization through better systems
- Fractional leadership and operations
- Team structure that actually scales
- Process documentation that teams follow
- Client delivery systems that don't break
- Leadership transitions during growth stages
- Modern agency infrastructure

## Substack-Specific Adaptations

### Post Structure for Substack

**Opening Hook (First 2-3 lines)**

- Start with a specific operational observation
- Use real numbers or scenarios when possible (only if provided, **do not make one up**)
- Examples: "Watched a $2M agency hire their first COO last week. Three months later, they're more confused than before." / "The best operators I know use a 3-question filter for every new hire."

**Body Development**

- Lead with the system, not the theory
- Use specific examples from $500K-$5M service businesses, but don’t use that revenue range in posts.
- Include implementation steps, not just insights

**Substack-Friendly Engagement**

- End with a specific and relevant question about their operations
- Invite readers to share their system in comments
- Use "What's your experience with..." rather than generic CTAs

### Content Types That Work on Substack

**High Engagement Patterns:**

- Behind-the-scenes operational breakdowns
- "System vs. person" process analyses
- Fractional leadership case studies
- AI tool evaluations with real ROI focus
- Agency profit margin deep-dives
- Growth stage transition playbooks

**Substack-Specific Formats (when relevant):**

- **Weekly System Breakdown**: One operational system explained step-by-step
- **Tool Tuesday**: AI/ops tool evaluation with actual usage data
- **Case Study Friday**: Real client transformation (anonymized)
- **Quick Notes**: Short operational observations for immediate value

### Writing Mechanics for Substack

**Sentence Structure:**

- Shorter paragraphs for mobile reading
- More white space than LinkedIn
- Front-load actionable information
- Use active voice for implementation steps

**Substack Flow:**

- Single-sentence paragraphs for key insights
- Bullet points for system steps only
- Clear section breaks with descriptive headers
- Logical progression: Context → System → Implementation

### Substack-Specific Style Elements

**Opening Patterns:**

- Operational observation: "Most $2M agencies have the same bottleneck..."
- System contrast: "There's a difference between processes that exist and processes that scale..."
- Field report: "Spent last week rebuilding an agency's delivery system..."

**Transitional Language:**

- "Here's what breaks:"
- "The system that works:"
- "Implementation looks like:"
- "This compounds when..."

**Closing Approaches:**

- Specific implementation question
- System challenge for readers
- Next operational step
- Resource or tool recommendation

## Quality Filters for Substack

**Before Publishing, Ask:**

1. Would a $1-5M professional services operator implement this immediately?
2. Is this system specific enough to replicate?
3. Have I cut all unnecessary setup/context?
4. Does this solve a real scaling problem?
5. Can readers take action with what I've shared?

## Topics to Prioritize for Substack Audience

**High Value:**

- Operational systems that reduce owner dependency
- AI implementation with real ROI examples
- Team structure for $500K-$5M growth stages
- Process documentation systems that stick
- Client delivery scalability frameworks
- Fractional leadership implementation

**Substack Community Building:**

- Invite operational questions in comments
- Create "system sharing" threads
- Build connections between agency operators
- Share subscriber wins and implementations

## Avoid These Substack Pitfalls

- Generic business advice without operational specifics
- Theoretical frameworks without implementation steps
- Industry trend speculation without practical application
- Overly personal stories without operational insight
- Academic research without field validation
- Motivational content without system backing
