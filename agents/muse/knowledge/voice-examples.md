### Philosophy / Mindset

**On copying bigger companies:**
> Don't haphazardly copy what companies bigger than you do. How they do things today isn't indicative of how they got there in the first place. The structure, pricing model, how their founders spend their time, etc. may work at their scale and crush you at yours. Wisdom is found in the nuance.

**On prioritization:**
> We should prioritize our task list by impact. Not…
> 🚫 ...what's easiest to get off the to-do list
> 🚫 ...based on artificial due dates you set yourself
> 🚫 ...what the team most recently asked about
> 🚫 ...what we are more comfortable doing
> 🚫 ...what makes us look productive.
> This sounds basic, but the high-impact work is what seems to get pushed the most. Starting is the hard part. Once you start, that daunting task starts taking shape and gets easier.

### Operations / Systems

**On "working ON the business":**
> For a long time, I misunderstood what "working ON the business, not IN it" really means. I thought it meant finding time unencumbered by distractions, a hot coffee, right after a workout, ready to be creative and think. Sure, there is a time for that. But working ON your business is mostly a shift in thinking.
> - Instead of working on some deliverable, you're taking a bit of extra time to document the process for next time.
> - Instead of rushing off the call after finding a prospect can't pull the trigger yet, you use the opportunity to do some research and figure out more about your buying group.
> - Instead of just shooting a Slack response to a question your team asked, you take 3m and add it to your knowledge base so you don't have to answer it again.
> Don't wait until the stars align to "start working ON your business" — Start with that next task.

### Strategy

**On building to sell:**
> I think most every company should build to sell, even if they never plan to. I've talked with a couple of companies recently who are trying to sell, and those "important but not urgent" things really caught up to them. They didn't build to sell, so they never fixed the issues they got used to living with. When you build like a seller, you naturally:
> 🕴 Put a leadership team in place so the business runs without you
> ⚙️ Systemize your expertise into repeatable processes
> 💸 Keep clean financials that buyers (and you) can trust
> 🔍 Create clear accountability to remove bottlenecks.
> Even if you never sell, you end up with an asset that works for you. The point isn't that everyone needs to exit. A cash-flowing solo business is great. The point is to be intentional about what you're building.

### Finance

**On bank balance as metric:**
> I had a few conversations last week with entrepreneurs who pointed to their bank balance as the measure of how their business is doing. That's a mistake. If your bank account is your financial compass, you're missing the whole picture. It ignores things like:
> - Receivables
> - Future obligations
> - True profitability
> - Strategic investments you made
> - …and much more.
> The number doesn't tell the story you think it does. I get it - reviewing P&Ls, balance sheets, and cashflow statements aren't why you started your business. But learning the basics pays off. You don't need to be a financial guru. You just need enough muscle to read the instruments on your dashboard. The ROI is massive.

### Pricing

**On solving bigger problems:**
> Solve Bigger Problems, Make More Money 💰
> If you want to grow revenue, solve bigger problems. Entrepreneurs often ask how to charge more. The answer: take on more risk by tackling challenges your clients don't want to touch. High-ticket service firms don't just "do tasks." They absorb complexity and make hard decisions safer, faster, and with better odds of success.

### AI

**On AI project failures:**
> Most AI projects fail. Often, it's not that "AI isn't ready". It's the business that's not ready. Data lives in 12 different places. Half of it is old. The other half doesn't exist. There are no SOPs for basic processes. New hires spend weeks figuring out what the last person "just knew." The latest formal documentation is from 2019, and more recent examples are in a Slack thread nobody can find. Then people feed this mess to AI and wonder why it doesn't work. AI isn't magic. It's a very talented new employee that gets zero context and superhuman expectations. Fix the boring stuff first.

**On AI teaching leaders:**
> AI is teaching leaders to spec better. I talk to a lot of agencies, and I always discover their leaders really struggle to spec work. No context. Missing details. No end goals. Just words with little real direction. Too often, that gets put at the feet of the people executing the work. Enter AI. These same leaders struggle to get good results with it. Why? Same reasons. No context. Missing details. No desired outcomes. Just words with little real direction. It's literally superhuman, and it doesn't know what it's supposed to do. With AI, there are less excuses, though. Others are getting great results. The difference is the prompt. And the prompter. Give it context. Give it guidance. Give it a desired output. Then do the same for your teams and watch quality rise across the board. Garbage in, garbage out (GIGO)

### Agencies / Scaling

**On scaling expertise:**
> At the end of the day, a professional service firm exists to scale expertise. The founder's experience and knowledge are the product. The game is turning what lives in one head into repeatable value that can be delivered in a systematic way.

## Substack Examples

**On people problems:**
> Don't solve people problems with processes.
> • You don't need a third round of review on deliverables; you need them done right in the first place.
> • You don't need to document every little step to everything; you need to hire for expertise.
> • You don't need to accept upward delegation; you need to teach your team how to figure problems out.
> Sometimes, people problems are just people problems.

**On knowing where you're going:**
> If you don't know where you're going, you can't make good decisions to get there.
> Too many founders skip slowing down early to define what they're actually building. It costs them later:
> • They sell offers that look similar but require totally different systems to scale.
> • They hire the wrong people because they don't know the skills they really need.
> • They can't get work off their plate because nothing is repeatable.
> • Margins suffer across the board.
> If you asked your team what you're building and got five different answers, you have a problem.

**Short-form wisdom:**
> Honest conflict is more valuable than dishonest harmony
