# LinkedIn Content Style Guide for Jacob Brain

## **Core Writing Philosophy**

**Sharp, pragmatic, direct.** Cut through industry noise with insights that actually matter. Respect your audience's intelligence—they don't need hand-holding, they need clarity and actionable perspective.

## **Voice & Tone**

- **Conversational authority**: Sound like you're in the room, not lecturing from above
- **Healthy skepticism**: Challenge conventional wisdom, especially overcomplicated marketing processes
- **Plain language**: Punch through jargon with clear, concise phrasing
- **Dry wit when appropriate**: Light touch, never forced
- **Honesty over harmony**: Tell uncomfortable truths about business operations

## **Content Themes & Expertise Areas**

**Primary Focus:**

- Professional services operations (agencies, consultancies, service businesses)
- AI integration in business processes
- Systems vs. person-dependent expertise
- Revenue scaling challenges ($1M-$5M+ growth stages)
- Profit optimization and operational efficiency

**Secondary Themes:**

- Leadership accountability and non-reactive management
- Modern agency structure and team building
- Sales process efficiency vs. friction
- Internal vs. client-facing process alignment

## **Post Structure Formula**

### **Hook (First Line)**

- Start with observation, contrarian take, or surprising insight
- Keep under 15 words when possible
- Examples: "Most AI projects fail." / "Bad employees hate accountability." / "AI is teaching leaders to spec better."

### **Core Message Development**

- Lead with the insight, not the setup
- Use specific examples over abstract theory
- Structure: Problem → Why it matters → What to do about it
- Include real-world scenarios from agency/service business context

### **Engagement Elements**

- End with thought-provoking observation, not generic CTA
- Use line breaks for scanability
- Bullet points sparingly—only for clear lists
- No emoji overuse (occasional strategic placement only)

## **Content Types That Perform**

**High Engagement Patterns:**

- Process critique with alternative approach
- Counter-narrative to accepted industry wisdom
- Behind-the-scenes business operations insights
- AI/automation practical applications
- Agency profitability and structure analysis

**Avoid:**

- Generic motivational content
- Over-explaining basic concepts
- Industry trend speculation without practical angle
- Personal anecdotes without business insight

## **Writing Mechanics**

**Sentence Structure:**

- Vary length for rhythm
- Front-load important information
- Use active voice
- Cut unnecessary qualifiers ("I think," "maybe," "perhaps")

**Paragraph Flow:**

- Single-sentence paragraphs for emphasis
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- White space for readability
- Logic progression: setup → insight → implication

## **Specific Style Elements**

**Opening Patterns:**

- Direct observation: "Restaurant websites are a reminder..."
- Contrarian statement: "There are $1m agencies making more profit than >$5m agencies"
- Process critique: "I have been looking at a few new ABM products..."

**Transitional Language:**

- "But here's the thing:"
- "That's why..."
- "The problem is..."
- "And it pays off."

**Closing Approaches:**

- Challenge assumption
- Practical next step
- Broader implication
- Warning about inaction

## **Quality Filters**

**Before Publishing, Ask:**

1. Would an experienced operator learn something new?
2. Is this insight specific enough to be actionable?
3. Have I cut all unnecessary words?
4. Does this challenge conventional thinking constructively?
5. Would I want to read this if someone else wrote it?

## **Topics to Prioritize**

- Operational bottlenecks in service businesses
- AI tool evaluation and implementation
- Team structure optimization
- Process documentation and systemization
- Profit margin analysis and improvement
- Client delivery scalability
- Leadership mindset shifts for growth stages

## **Avoid These Pitfalls**

- Industry buzzword bingo
- Vague productivity advice
- Overly personal anecdotes without business relevance
- Generic "mindset" content
- Defending obvious positions
- Academic theory without practical application
