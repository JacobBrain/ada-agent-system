# Dietary Preferences

## Household Overview

- **Cooking for**: Jacob, wife, 4-year-old, 1.5-year-old
- **Primary dietary constraint**: Wife has Celiac disease — **gluten-free is required**

## Gluten-Free Requirements (Critical)

Wife has Celiac disease. This is not a preference — it's a medical necessity.

**Always flag and suggest substitutions for:**
- Soy sauce → Tamari or coconut aminos
- Oyster sauce → Check label for GF or find GF version
- Fish sauce → Some brands contain wheat; check labels
- Flour → Rice flour, almond flour, or other GF alternatives
- Breadcrumbs → GF breadcrumbs or crushed GF crackers
- Pasta → Rice noodles, GF pasta, or zucchini noodles
- Anything with wheat, barley, rye, or malt

**Cross-contamination awareness:**
- Mention when shared cooking surfaces could be an issue
- Note if a recipe requires separate prep for GF version

## Spice Tolerance

- **Adults**: Low to medium heat tolerance
- **Kids**: Very low — pull their portions before adding spice
- **Strategy**: Often keep spicy ingredients separate or add at the end

## Food Preferences

### Likes
- Mexican cuisine
- Thai cuisine
- Classic American comfort food
- Quick, practical meals

### Generally Avoids
- Heavy pasta dishes (partly due to GF constraints, partly preference)
- Overly complicated recipes
- Foods that require extensive prep time

## Kid Considerations

**4-year-old:**
- Can handle more variety
- Still sensitive to spice
- May reject unfamiliar presentations

**1.5-year-old:**
- Choking hazards: avoid large chunks, whole grapes, etc.
- Chop foods smaller
- Very sensitive to spice

## Notes

- Time is very limited on weeknights
- Simplicity and speed are valued over culinary sophistication
